# MiS:IGE Mirror

## Preview
A mirror of *Mission in Snowdriftland: Indie Games Edition*. The preview version has been fully restored.

### Differences from Final
This is the preview version, likely meant to be shown to other indie devs. As such, the game is restricted to level 1, you cannot open presents, and the Help button does not work.
However, there is a FPS counter in this version of the game when you play a level.

## Full

The full version currently is a WIP for restoration. It runs, but it runs off of the preview version's code, and I'm trying to replace as much of it as I can with authentic 2010 files.
