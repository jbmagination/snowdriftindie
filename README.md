# MiS:IGEP Mirror
A mirror of the preview version of *Mission in Snowdriftland: Indie Games Edition*.

## Differences from Final
This is the preview version, likely meant to be shown to other indie devs. As such, the game is restricted to level 1, you cannot open presents, and the Help button does not work.
However, there is a FPS counter in this version of the game when you play a level.

## Custom Additions
I added an extra empty object to the HTML file that your browser will assume is Flash content. As such, you can properly click on it to load Adobe Flash.
