# MiS:IGEP Mirror
A mirror of the preview version of *Mission in Snowdriftland: Indie Games Edition*.

## Differences
This is the preview version, likely meant to be shown to other indie devs. As such, the game is restricted to level 1, you cannot open presents, and the Help button does not work.
However, there is a FPS counter in this version of the game when you play a level.
