# MiS:IGE Mirror

## Preview
A mirror of the preview version of *Mission in Snowdriftland: Indie Games Edition*.

### Differences from Final
This is the preview version, likely meant to be shown to other indie devs. As such, the game is restricted to level 1, you cannot open presents, and the Help button does not work.
However, there is a FPS counter in this version of the game when you play a level.

## Full

The full version currently doesn't work. I'm working on trying to get it to work, rewards included if possible, and once I get that done I'll let you know.
