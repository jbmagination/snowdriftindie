# MiS:IGE Mirror

A mirror of *Mission in Snowdriftland: Indie Games Edition*. Also check out the 2006 Mission in Snowdriftland mirror [here](https://snowdriftland.live) by [Minerscale](https://github.com/Minerscale), the [chick chick BOOM WiiWare website mirror](http://github.com/jbmagination/chickchickBOOM) by me.

## Preview

This version has been fully restored.

### Differences from Final
This is the preview version, likely meant to be shown to other indie devs. As such, the game is restricted to level 1, you cannot open presents, and the Help button does not work.
However, there is a FPS counter in this version of the game when you play a level.

## Full

The full version currently is a WIP for restoration. All that's missing is:
* Support Us button functionality
* Goodie XML files

### Differences from Original
Some files aren't actually original files from 2010-- they're actually recreated if not taken from the preview version (a notice will be supplied with those). This is as close as we can get to the Indie Games Edition, if it's not already.
